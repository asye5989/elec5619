Portrait of an INFJ Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging (Introverted Intuition
with Extraverted Feeling) The Protector As an INFJ, your primary mode of living
is focused internally, where you take things in primarily via intuition. Your
secondary mode is external, where you deal with things according to how you feel
about them, or how they fit with your personal value system. INFJ's are gentle,
caring, complex and highly intuitive individuals. Artistic and creative, they
live in a world of hidden meanings and possibilities. Only one percent of the
population has an INFJ Personality Type, making it the rarest of all the types.
INFJ’s place great importance on having things orderly and systematic in their
outer world. They put a lot of energy into identifying the best system for
getting things done, and constantly define and re-define the priorities in their
lives. On the other hand, INFJ’s operate within themselves on an intuitive basis
which is entirely spontaneous. They know things intuitively, without being able
to pinpoint why, and without detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. They are
usually right, and they usually know it. Consequently, INFJ’s put a tremendous
amount of faith into their instincts and intuitions. This is something of a
conflict between the inner and outer worlds, and may result in the INFJ not
being as organized as other Judging types tend to be. Or we may see some signs
of disarray in an otherwise orderly tendency, such as a consistently messy desk.
INFJ’s have uncanny insight into people and situations. They get "feelings"
about things and intuitively understand them. As an extreme example, some INFJ’s
report experiences of a psychic nature, such as getting strong feelings about
there being a problem with a loved one, and discovering later that they were in
a car accident. This is the sort of thing that other types may scorn and scoff
at, and the INFJ themselves does not really understand their intuition at a
level which can be verbalized. Consequently, most INFJ’s are protective of their
inner selves, sharing only what they choose to share when they choose to share
it. They are deep, complex individuals, who are quite private and typically
difficult to understand. INFJ’s hold back part of themselves, and can be
secretive. But the INFJ is as genuinely warm as they are complex. INFJ’s hold a
special place in the heart of people who they are close to, who are able to see
their special gifts and depth of caring. INFJ’s are concerned for people's
feelings, and try to be gentle to avoid hurting anyone. They are very sensitive
to conflict, and cannot tolerate it very well. Situations which are charged with
conflict may drive the normally peaceful INFJ into a state of agitation or
charged anger. They may tend to internalize conflict into their bodies, and
experience health problems when under a lot of stress. Because the INFJ has such
strong intuitive capabilities, they trust their own instincts above all else.
This may result in an INFJ stubbornness and tendency to ignore other people's
opinions. They believe that they're right. On the other hand, INFJ is a
perfectionist who doubts that they are living up to their full potential. INFJ’s
are rarely at complete peace with themselves - there's always something else
they should be doing to improve themselves and the world around them. They
believe in constant growth, and don't often take time to revel in their
accomplishments. They have strong value systems, and need to live their lives in
accordance with what they feel is right. In deference to the Feeling aspect of
their personalities, INFJ’s are in some ways gentle and easy going. Conversely,
they have very high expectations of themselves, and frequently of their
families. They don't believe in compromising their ideals. INFJ is a natural
nurturer; patient, devoted and protective. They make loving parents and usually
have strong bonds with their offspring. They have high expectations of their
children, and push them to be thebest that they can be. This can sometimes
manifest itself in the INFJ being hard-nosed and stubborn. But generally,
children of an INFJ get devoted and sincere parental guidance, combined with
deep caring. In the workplace, the INFJ usually shows up in areas where they can
be creative and somewhat independent. They have a natural affinity for art, and
many excel in the sciences, where they make use of their intuition. INFJ’s can
also be found in service-oriented professions. They are not good at dealing with
minutia or very detailed tasks. The INFJ will either avoid such things, or else
go to the other extreme and become enveloped in the details to the extent that
they can no longer see the big picture. An INFJ who has gone the route of
becoming meticulous about details may be highly critical of other individuals
who are not. The INFJ individual is gifted in ways that other types are not.
Life is not necessarily easy for the INFJ, but they are capable of great depth
of feeling and personal achievement. Jungian functional preference ordering:
Dominant: Introverted Intuition Auxiliary: Extraverted Feeling Tertiary:
Introverted Thinking Inferior: Extraverted Sensing INFJ’s generally have the
following traits:  Intuitively understand people and situations  Idealistic 
Highly principled  Complex and deep  Natural leaders  Sensitive and
compassionate towards people  Service-oriented  Future-oriented  Value deep,
authentic relationships  Reserved about expressing their true selves  Dislike
dealing with details unless they enhance or promote their vision  Constantly
seeking meaning and purpose in everything  Creative and visionary  Intense and
tightly-wound  Can work logically and rationally - use their intuition to
understand the goal and work backwards towards it The INFJ is a special
individual who needs more out of a career than a job. They need to feel as if
everything they do in their lives is in sync with their strong value systems -
with what they believe to be right. Accordingly, the INFJ should choose a career
in which they're able to live their daily lives in accordance with their
deeply-held principles, and which supports them in their life quest to be doing
something meaningful. Since INFJ’s have such strong value systems, and
persistent intuitive visions which lend them a sense of "knowing", they do best
in positions in which they are leaders, rather than followers. Although they can
happily follow individuals who are leading in a direction which the INFJ fully
supports, they will very unhappy following in any other situation. INFJ
Relationships INFJ’s are warm and affirming people who are usually also deep and
complex. They're likely to seek out and promote relationships that are intense
and meaningful. They tend to be perfectionists, and are always striving for the
Ultimate Relationship. For the most part, this is a positive feature, but
sometimes works against the INFJ if they fall into the habit of moving from
relationship to relationship, always in search of a more perfect partner. In
general, the INFJ is a deeply warm and caring person who is highly invested in
the health of their close relationships, and puts forth a lot of effort to make
them positive. They are valued bythose close to them for these special
qualities. They seek long-term, lifelong relationships, although they don't
always find them. INFJ Strengths  Warm and affirming by nature  Dedicated to
achieving the ultimate relationship  Sensitive and concerned for others'
feelings  Usually have good communication skills, especially written  Take their
commitments very seriously, and seek lifelong relationships  Have very high
expectations for themselves and others (both a strength and weakness)  Good
listeners  Are able to move on after a relationship has ended (once they're sure
it's over) INFJ Weaknesses  Tendency to hold back part of themselves  Not good
with money or practical day-to-day life necessities  Extreme dislike of conflict
and criticism  Have very high expectations for themselves and others (both a
strength and weakness)  Have difficulty leaving a bad relationship What does
Success mean to an INFJ?
