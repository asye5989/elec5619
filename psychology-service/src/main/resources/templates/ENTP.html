ortrait of an ENTP - Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving (Extraverted
Intuition with Introverted Thinking) The Visionary As an ENTP, your primary mode
of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your
intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things
rationally and logically. With Extraverted Intuition dominating their
personality, the ENTP's primary interest in life is understanding the world that
they live in. They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the
situations they are presented in their lives. Using their intuition to process
this information, they are usually extremely quick and accurate in their ability
to size up a situation. With the exception of their ENFP cousin, the ENTP has a
deeper understanding of their environment than any of the other types. This
ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a
distinct advantage in their lives. They generally understand things quickly and
with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible and adapt well to a wide
range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very
aware of possibilities, and this makes them quite resourceful when solving
problems. ENTP's are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see
possibilities everywhere. They get excited and enthusiastic about their ideas,
and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way, they get the
support that they need to fulfill their visions. ENTP’s are less interested in
developing plans of actions or making decisions than they are in generating
possibilities and ideas. Following through on the implementation of an idea is
usually a chore to the ENTP. For some ENTP’s, this results in the habit of never
finishing what they start. The ENTP who has not developed their Thinking process
will have problems with jumping enthusiastically from idea to idea, without
following through on their plans. The ENTP needs to take care to think through
their ideas fully in order to take advantage of them. The ENTP's auxiliary
process of Introverted Thinking drives their decision making process. Although
the ENTP is more interested in absorbing information than in making decisions,
they are quite rational and logical in reaching conclusions. When they apply
Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the outcome can be very powerful
indeed. A well-developed ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and
enterprising. ENTP’s are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy
verbal sparring with others. They love to debate issues, and may even switch
sides sometimes just for the love of the debate. When they express their
underlying principles, however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and
intensely. The ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "Lawyer" type.
The ENTP "lawyer" quickly and accurately understands a situation, and
objectively and logically acts upon the situation. Their Thinking side makes
their actions and decisions based on an objective list of rules or laws. If the
ENTP was defending someone who had actually committed a crime, they are likely
to take advantage of quirks in the law that will get their client off the hook.
If they were to actually win the case, they would see their actions as
completely fair and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful.
The guilt or innocence of their client would not be as relevant. If this type of
reasoning goes incompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it could result in a
character that is perceived by others as unethical or even dishonest. The ENTP,
who does not naturally consider the more personal or human element in decision
making, should take care to notice the subjective, personal side of situations.
This is a potential problem are for ENTP’s. Although their logical abilities
lend strength and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate them from their
feelings and from other people; The least developed area for the ENTP is the
Sensing-Feeling arena. If the Sensing areas are neglected, the ENTP may tend to
not take care of details in their life. If their Feeling part is neglected, the
ENTP may not value other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and
aggressive. Under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate
possibilities, and become obsessed with minor details. These details may seem to
be extremely important to the ENTP, but in reality are usually not important to
the big picture. In general, ENTP’s are upbeat visionaries. They highly value
knowledge, and spend much of their lives seeking a higher understanding. They
live in the world of possibilities, and become excited about concepts,
challenges and difficulties. When presented with a problem, they're good at
improvising and quickly come up with a creative solution. Creative, clever,
curious, and theoretical, ENTP’s have a broad range of possibilities in their
lives. Jungian functional preference ordering for ENTP: Dominant: Extraverted
