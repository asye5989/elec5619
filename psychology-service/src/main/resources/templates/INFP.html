Portrait of an INFP - Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving (Introverted
Feeling with Extraverted Intuition) The Idealist As an INFP, your primary mode
of living is focused internally, where you deal with things according to how you
feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value system. Your secondary
mode is external, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. INFP's,
more than other iNtuitive Feeling types, are focused on making the world a
better place for people. Their primary goal is to find out their meaning in
life. What is their purpose? How can they best serve humanity in their lives?
They are idealists and perfectionists, who drive themselves hard in their quest
for achieving the goals they have identified for themselves INFP’s are highly
intuitive about people. They rely heavily on their intuitions to guide them, and
use their discoveries to constantly search for value in life. They are on a
continuous mission to find the truth and meaning underlying things. Every
encounter and every piece of knowledge gained gets sifted through the INFP's
value system, and is evaluated to see if it has any potential to help the INFP
define or refine their own path in life. The goal at the end of the path is
always the same - the INFP is driven to help people and make the world a better
place. Generally thoughtful and considerate, INFP’s are good listeners and put
people at ease. Although they may be reserved in expressing emotion, they have a
very deep well of caring and are genuinely interested in understanding people.
This sincerity is sensed by others, making the INFP a valued friend and
confidante. An INFP can be quite warm with people he or she knows well. INFP’s
do not like conflict, and go to great lengths to avoid it. If they must face it,
they will always approach it from the perspective of their feelings. In conflict
situations, INFP’s place little importance on who is right and who is wrong.
They focus on the way that the conflict makes them feel, and indeed don't really
care whether or not they're right. They don't want to feel badly. This trait
sometimes makes them appear irrational and illogical in conflict situations. On
the other hand, INFP’s make very good mediators, and are typically good at
solving other people's conflicts, because they intuitively understand people's
perspectives and feelings, and genuinely want to help them. INFP’s are flexible
and laid-back, until one of their values is violated. In the face of their value
system being threatened, INFP’s can become aggressive defenders, fighting
passionately for their cause. When an INFP has adopted a project or job which
they're interested in, it usually becomes a "cause" for them. Although they are
not detail-oriented individuals, they will cover every possible detail with
determination and vigor when working for their "cause".When it comes to the
mundane details of life maintenance, INFP’s are typically completely unaware of
such things. They might go for long periods without noticing a stain on the
carpet, but carefully and meticulously brush a speck of dust off of their
project booklet. INFP’s do not like to deal with hard facts and logic. Their
focus on their feelings and the Human Condition makes it difficult for them to
deal with impersonal judgment. They don't understand or believe in the validity
of impersonal judgment, which makes them naturally rather ineffective at using
it. Most INFP’s will avoid impersonal analysis, although some have developed
this ability and are able to be quite logical. Under stress, it's not uncommon
for INFP’s to misuse hard logic in the heat of anger, throwing out fact after
(often inaccurate) fact in an emotional outburst. INFP’s have very high
standards and are perfectionists. Consequently, they are usually hard on
themselves, and don't give themselves enough credit. INFP’s may have problems
working on a project in a group, because their standards are likely to be higher
than other members' of the group. In group situations, they may have a "control"
problem. The INFP needs to work on balancing their high ideals with the
requirements of every day living. Without resolving this conflict, they will
never be happy with themselves, and they may become confused and paralyzed about
what to do with their lives. INFP’s are usually talented writers. They may be
awkward and uncomfortable with expressing themselves verbally, but have a
wonderful ability to define and express what they're feeling on paper. INFP’s
also appear frequently in social service professions, such as counseling or
teaching. They are at their best in situations where they're working towards the
public good, and in which they don't need to use hard logic. INFP’s who function
in their well-developed sides can accomplish great and wonderful things, which
they will rarely give themselves credit for. Some of the great, humanistic
catalysts in the world have been INFP’s. Jungian functional preference ordering:

Want to be seen and appreciated for who they are The INFP is a special,
sensitive individual who needs a career which is more than a job. The INFP needs
to feel that everything they do in their lives is in accordance with their
strongly-felt value systems, and is moving them and/or others in a positive,
growthoriented direction. They are driven to do something meaningful and
purposeful with their lives. The INFP will be happiest in careers which allow
them to live their daily lives in accordance with their values, and which work
towards the greater good of humanity. It's worth mentioning that nearly all of
the truly great writers in the world have been INFP’s. INFP Relationships INFP’s
present a calm, pleasant face to the world. They appear to be tranquil and
peaceful to others, with simple desires. In fact, the INFP internally feels his
or her life intensely. In the relationship arena, this causes them to have a
very deep capacity for love and caring which is not frequently found with such
intensity in the other types. The INFP does not devote their intense feelings
towards just anyone, and are relatively reserved about expressing their
inner-most feelings. They reserve their deepest love and caring for a select few
who are closest to them. INFP’s are generally laid-back, supportive and
nurturing in their close relationships. With Introverted Feeling dominating
their personality, they're very sensitive and in-tune with people's feelings,
and feel genuine concern and caring for others. Slow to trust others and
cautious in the beginning of a relationship, an INFP will be fiercely loyal once
they are committed. With their strong inner core of values, they are intense
individuals who value depth and authenticity in their relationships, and hold
those who understand and accept the INFP's perspectives in especially high
regard. INFP’s are usually adaptable and congenial, unless one of their ruling
principles has been violated, in which case they stop adapting and become
staunch defenders of their values. They will be uncharacteristically ha
