Portrait of an ESTJ - Extraverted Sensing Thinking Judging (Extraverted Thinking
with Introverted Sensing) The Guardian As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living
is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your
secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a
literal, concrete fashion. ESTJ's live in a world of facts and concrete needs.
They live in the present, with their eye constantly scanning their personal
environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically.
They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs.
They expect the same of others, and have no patience or understanding of
individuals who do not value these systems. They value competence and
efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts. ESTJ’s are
take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should
be, that they naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and
aggressive. They are extremely talented at devising systems and plans for
action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a
specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they
have such strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without
reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their standards. But at least their
expressions can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely
straightforward and honest. The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of
the community. He or she takes their commitments seriously, and follows their
own standards of "good citizenship" to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with
people, and likes to have fun. ESTJ’s can be very boisterous and fun at social
events, especially activities which are focused on the family, community, or
work. The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to
become overly detail-oriented. Since they put a lot of weight in their own
beliefs, it's important that they remember to value other people's input and
opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with
fulfilling other's needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's
feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which demand more emotional
sensitivity. When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from
others. They feel as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their
efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is very verbal and
doesn't have any problem expressing themselves, when under stress they have a
hard time putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.
ESTJ’s value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do
all that they can to enhance and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn,
vote, join the PTA, attend home owner’s association meetings, and generally do
anything that they can to promote personal and social security. The ESTJ puts
forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything
that they think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good
amount of energy. He or she is conscientious, practical, realistic, and
dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is important to
work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value
the importance of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if
the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such goals to practical concerns, you
can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding them and incorporating
them into their quest for clarity and security. Jungian functional preference
